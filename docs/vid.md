# Video Capture Tool

This document outlines the implementation of a video capture tool that extracts knowledge from video content using our existing vision infrastructure.

## Overview

The video capture tool leverages our existing vision model infrastructure to process video frames and extract meaningful information. The system:
1. Processes video files to extract frames at configurable intervals
2. Analyzes frames using our vision models
3. Generates structured knowledge output from the analyzed frames

## Implementation Details

### Key Features

1. **Video Validation**
   - Validates video format and duration
   - Ensures video meets configuration requirements

2. **Frame Extraction**
   - Extracts frames at specified intervals based on frame rate
   - Optimizes frames for processing (resizing, format conversion)

3. **Frame Analysis**
   - Processes extracted frames using vision models
   - Supports both synchronous and asynchronous processing

4. **Knowledge Extraction**
   - Combines frame analysis to generate structured output
   - Provides a simple interface for processing entire videos
